# SIT: Sapiens Twitch Integration

An attempt to provide twitch integration as a lua mod for the WIP game, Sapiens.
For now it will utilize the existing examples given by mjdave and implement them as commands.
Prolly won't work since there is no method to test the mod since the game is unreleased, but ideally it will function once the game launches.

To do:

UI Color Change via Twitch Commands.

Future Plans:

Sapien Naming.

Entity Spawning.

Entity Manipulation (Sickness, Instant growth, etc.)

Season Control.

Events.
